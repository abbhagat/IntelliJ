/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until 
 * a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
 * A CountDownLatch is initialized with a given count. The await methods 
 * block until the current count reaches zero due to invocations of 
 * the countDown() method, after which all waiting threads are released 
 * and any subsequent invocations of await return immediately. 
 * This is a one-shot phenomenon the count cannot be reset. 
 * If you need a version that resets the count, consider using a CyclicBarrier.
