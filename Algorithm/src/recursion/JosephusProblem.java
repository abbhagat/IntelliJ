/**
 * There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed.
 * The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction.
 * In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed.
 * The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed),
 * until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
 * Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth person is killed in circle.
 * The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.
 * <p>
 * For example, if n = 5 and k = 2, then the safe position is 3.
 * Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then person at position 4 is killed, then person at position 1 is killed.
 * Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. So the person at position 3 survives.
 * If n = 7 and k = 3, then the safe position is 4. The persons at positions 3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1 are killed in order, and person at position 4 survives.
 * <p>
 * josephus(n, k) = (josephus(n - 1, k) + k-1) % n + 1
 * josephus(1, k) = 1
 * <p>
 * After the first person (kth from beginning) is killed, n-1 persons are left.
 * So we call josephus(n – 1, k) to get the position with n-1 persons.
 * But the position returned by josephus(n – 1, k) will consider the position starting from k%n + 1.
 * So, we must make adjustments to the position returned by josephus(n – 1, k).
