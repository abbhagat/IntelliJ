 * Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.
 * And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2.
 * Let the input array be arr[] and size of the array be size.
