/**
 * The House Robber Problem states that, in a neighborhood in a city, there is a single row of n houses.
 * A thief is planning to carry a heist in this neighborhood. He knows how much gold is concealed in each of the houses.
 * However, in order to avoid triggering an alarm and raise suspicion, he plans to carry heist in such a way that no two consecutive houses are looted.
 * i.e. if the house at index = i is looted, the houses at i-1 and i+1 are not looted.
 * Find out what is the maximum number of gold the thief can steal following the given constraints.
 * Input 1: arr[] = [2,3,4,2,3]
 * Maximum gold = [2, X, 4, X, 3] = 9
 * Output: 6
 * Input 2: arr[] = [3,8,10,4,2,3]
 * Maximum gold = [3, X, 10, X, X, 3] = 16
 * Output: 16
 * Input 2: arr[] = [3,8,10,4,2,3,11]
 * Maximum gold = [3, X, 10, X, 2, X, 11] = 26
 * Output: 26
 * Explanation: in example 2, the thief has to get to 1st, 3rd, and 6th house to collect the maximum number of gold given the constraints.
 * Start traversing arr[] from right to left.
 * If an element arr[i] is selected then the next element (arr[i-1]) cannot be selected.
 * If an element(arr[i]) is not selected then the next element arr[i-1] can be selected.
 * Perform steps 2 and 3 recursively and return the maximum of values obtained in steps 2 and 3.
