/**
In daily share trading, a buyer buys shares in the morning and sells them on the same day.
If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day,
whereas the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (Sell->buy->sell->buy).
Given stock prices throughout the day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.
Examples:
Input: price[] = {10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80}; Output: 87
Trader earns 87 as a sum of 12, 75
Buy at 10, sell at 22,
Buy at 5 and sell at 80

Input: price[] = {2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80}; Output:  100
Trader earns 100 as a sum of 28 and 72
Buy at price 2, sell at 30, buy at 8 and sell at 80

Input: price[] = {100, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80}; Output: 72
Buy at price 8 and sell at 80.

Input:   price[] = {90, 80, 70, 60, 50}; Output:  0
Not possible to earn.

Input: prices[] = {3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4} Output: 6
Explanation:
Buy on Day 4 and Sell at Day 6 => Profit = 3 â€“ 0 = 3
Buy on Day 7 and Sell at Day 8 => Profit = 4 -1 = 3
Therefore, Total Profit = 3 + 3 = 6

Input: prices[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} Output: 4
Explanation:
Buy on Day 1 and sell at Day 6 => Profit = 5-1 = 4
Therefore, Total Profit = 4
