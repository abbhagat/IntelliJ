Threads and Classes
Here t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6 are the thread names

The complete declarations of  methods are:
method1: public static synchronized void method1()
method2: public static synchronized void method2()
method3: public static void method3()
method4: public synchronized int method4()
method5: public String method5()

t1.method1() starts execution as it attains class level lock of Manager class.
t2.method2() wait for its time to start execution, as it is a static synchronized method, it requires a class level lock, as t1 has already acquired class level lock t2 must wait until t1 execution.
t3.method2() waits as it requires class level lock, so it must wait until t1 releases the lock.
t4.method3() starts execution as it is static methods requires no lock
t5.method4() starts execution as it is instance or(normal) level synchronized method and requires object level lock, so it attains object level lock.
t6.method5() starts execution as it is an instance method or a normal method
