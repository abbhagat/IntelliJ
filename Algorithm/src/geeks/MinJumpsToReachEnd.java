/**
 * Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element.
 * Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).
 * If an element is 0, they cannot move through that element. If the end isnâ€™t reachable, return -1.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
 * Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 8 -> 9)
 * Explanation: Jump from 1st element to 2nd element as there is only 1 step, now there are three options 5, 8 or 9.
 * If 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9 can be reached. So 3 jumps are made.
 *
 * Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: In every step a jump is needed so the count of jumps is 10.
