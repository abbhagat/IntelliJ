/**
 * Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
 * It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning.
 * We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.
 * A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that the value in a parent node
 * is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes.
 * The former is called max heap, and the latter is called min-heap. The heap can be represented by a binary tree or array.
