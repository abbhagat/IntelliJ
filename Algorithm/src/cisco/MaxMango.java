/**
 * Given two integers W and C, representing the number of watermelons and coins,
 * the task is to find the maximum number of mangoes that can be bought given
 * that each mango costs 1 watermelon and X coins and y coins can be earned selling a watermelon.
 * Input: W = 10, C = 10, X = 1, Y = 1
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The most optimal way is to use 10 watermelons and 10 coins to buy 10 mangoes. Hence, the maximum number of mangoes that can be bought is 10.
 * <p>
 * Input: W = 4, C = 8, X = 4, Y = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The most optimal way is to sell one watermelon. Then, the number of coins increases by 4.
 * Therefore, the total number of coins becomes 12. Therefore, 3 watermelons and 12 coins can be used to buy 3 mangoes.
 * Hence, the maximum number of mangoes that can be bought is 3.
 * <p>
 * Approach: This problem can be solved using binary search. The idea is to find the maximum number of mangoes in the search space.
 * Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Initialize a variable ans as 0 to store the required result.
 * Initialize two variables l as 0, r as W to store the boundary regions of the search space for binary search.
 * Loop while l≤r and perform the following steps:
 * Store the middle value in a variable mid as (l+r)/2.
 * Check if mid number of mangoes can be bought using the given value of W, C, x, and y.
 * If true, then update ans to mid and search in the right part of mid by updating l to mid+1. Otherwise, update the value of r to mid-1.
 * Print the value of ans as the result
 * Time Complexity: O(log(W))
 * Auxiliary Space: O(1)
