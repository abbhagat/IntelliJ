Functional Requirement:-

1. View Feeds                    | GET getFeeds(String userID) List of 20 posts as feed
2. Create a POST                 | POST createPost(@RequestBody Post post)
3. Like and Comment on a POST    | POST interactionService(@RequestBody Interaction interaction)
4. Search for Users              | GET search(String searchString) Return 30 search results
5. Follow Users                  | POST followUser(String userId1, String userId2)
6. Send Notifications            |

NFR :-

1. Low Latency [ Search User Like/Comment ]
2. High Availability
3. View POST [Eventual Consistency]

Capacity Estimation :-

Number of POST per day = 100M/day and assume 1 Post is 10 MB in size
Total Storage is 100TB/day
Storage Amazon S3

We will be going with NoSQL Document Cassandra DB

1. User
2. Connection/Follower DB

   FollowerUserId   FollowingUserId
1.     A                     B
2.     A                     C
1.     C                     B

3. POST DB
    {
       PostID
       userID
       timeStamp
       Description
       url
    }
4. Interaction DB
   {
        postId
        userID
        like:
        comment:
        media:urls
   }
